            <p><strong>AWF Donation</strong> is an initiative put by community members to collect donations that will support research & development of fractal governance tools for web3 projects.</p>
            <p>As demonstrated by early experimentation in the <a href='https://www.edenoneos.com/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>Eden & Fractally communities</a>, We believe that a team of people can be more powerful than the sum of its members. When you donate to <strong>AWF Donation</strong>, you support a group of people working together to build tools that empower you to make a bigger impact in the world.</p>
            <p>You can use any wallet and donate any crypto. When you click on <strong>"Donate"</strong>, You will be directed to our donation page where you can make your donation. We use Copperx Protocol for secure, fast & affordable web3 donations. </p>
            <p>All donations will go into supporting research, development & training. All donations are voluntary and there's no commitment to deliver anything to any donor.</p>
            <p>Thanks for your support.</p>
